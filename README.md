This is the code for "How to use Q Learning in Video Games Easily" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

##Overview

This is the associated code for [this](https://youtu.be/A5eihauRQvo) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. This is a simple example of a type of [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)
called [Q learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning). 

	● Rules: The agent (yellow box) has to reach one of the goals to end the game (green or red cell).
	● Rewards: Each step gives a negative reward of -0.04. The red cell gives a negative reward of -1. The green one gives a positive reward of +1.
	● States: Each cell is a state the agent can be.
	● Actions: There are only 4 actions. Up, Down, Right, Left.

##Dependencies

Python 2.7

##Usage

Run `python Learner.py` in terminal to see the the bot in action. It'll find the optimal strategy pretty fast (like in 15 seconds)

##Challenge

The challenge for this video is to 

* modify the the game world so that it's bigger 
* add more obstacles
* have the bot start in a different position

**Bonus points if you modify the bot in some way that makes it more efficient**
